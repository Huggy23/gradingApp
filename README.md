# gradingApp
Done for my Programming Fundamentals Class

App allows a teacher to input a student's grades for four exams and four assignments. The sum is calculated and is used to detirmine the student's grade. 10 scores are then taken from other students in the class to determine the class average and standard deviation. These are used to create a "curve" standard. The student's final grade is then determined based on the curve system.
